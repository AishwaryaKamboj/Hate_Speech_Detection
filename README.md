# Hate_Speech_Detection
Designed and implemented a robust hate speech detection system to identify and mitigate instances of hate speech in online communication. The goal of this project was to create a model capable of accurately distinguishing between harmful and non-harmful language, contributing to the creation of safer online environments.
Designed and implemented a hate speech detection system to address the growing concern of hate speech in online communication platforms. 
Explored and selected appropriate machine learning models for hate speech detection, such as Natural Language 
Processing (NLP) models taking test data as 33%. 
Implemented a decision tree classifier, achieving an impressive accuracy of 97%.
